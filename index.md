## The Kerbinator 3000
### A project by Little Sandbox Invent

The Kerbinator 3000 was created with one purpose in mind: seek out drop-kerbs. 

Ok maybe this little button box can't do that by itself, but with help from you good people we can collect information about the location of drop-kerbs and populate an online map identifying where there is a drop-kerb nearby.

### Why would we do this, you might ask?

Well we were inspired by one of the volunteers at our tech club who uses a wheelchair and told us that sometimes, using the walking route on Google Maps to find her way is frustrating because, there isn't always a drop-kerb for her to use to cross the road and that often means she has to retrace her route until she find a place to cross.

So we thought: wouldn't it be great if you could plot a route that included drop-kerbs? But there's no data available about where they are so before we can create a handy interactive map, we need to find a way to collect that data.

Hopefully there's lots of helpful people around the place willing to help us crowd source that data using the kerbinator 3000.

## So what exactly is the Kerbinator 3000?

The Kerbinator 3000 is a button. When the button is pressed it records the GPS location to a text file stored on an SD card. 
These locations can then be sent to us (ideally automatically via a wifi connection) to add to a database which will then populate the interactive map on this website.

Once we have a working model, we'll make the specs available to download so people can build their own and start gathering data in their local area. 

But we're 13 year olds so we could also use some extra help in coding the interactive map and stuff, so if any local makers fancy lending a hand, please get in touch.
